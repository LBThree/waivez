            Although LB3 Development LLC may from time to time provide you with

            Development LLC is not a provider of legal services or legal advice

            that you use. In particular, you, not LB3 Development LLC, are
            responsible for determining the legal enforceability of any digital
            waivers of liability, including its compliance with The Electronic
            Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN, Pub. L. No.
            106-229, 14 Stat. 464, 15 U.S.C. ch. 96) and the Uniform Electronic
            Transactions Act (UETA) as the UETA may be adopted in your state.
            You further agree, in addition to any other provisions contained
            herein, and without limiting the scope of any other provision
            herein, to hold LB3 Development LLC, its parents, subsidiaries,
            affiliates, agents, officers, directors, members, employees,
            successors and assigns, harmless from any claim or demand, including
            reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and costs, that may arise in connection
            with your use of the digital waiver service and storage of digital
            waivers.

            Except to the extent expressly provided in the following paragraph,
            these TOS and the relationship between you and LB3 Development LLC
            shall be governed by the laws of the State of Oregon, excluding its
            conflicts of law provisions. You and LB3 Development LLC agree to
            submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
            located within the county of Deschutes, Oregon, to resolve any
            dispute or claim arising from these TOS. Specifically excluded from

            shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to

            parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and
            effect. The failure of LB3 Development LLC to exercise or enforce
            any right or provision of these TOS shall not constitute a waiver of
            such right or provision. You agree that, except as otherwise
            expressly provided in these TOS, there shall be no third-party
            beneficiaries to this agreement. Any translation of these TOS is
            done for local requirements and in the event of a dispute between
            the English and any non-English versions, the English version of
            these TOS shall govern. In the event that any action is commenced
            arising out of these TOS, the prevailing party shall be awarded it’s
            reasonable attorney’s fees.

            <br />
            <br />
            (e) Make available protected health information in a designated
            record set to the covered entity as necessary to satisfy covered
            entity’s obligations under 45 CFR 164.524. In the event that the
            business associate receives a request for access directly from the
            individual rather than the covered entity, the business associate
            will respond to a request for access by forwarding the individual’s
            request to the covered entity to fulfill. The covered entity has
            sole responsibility for handling requests for HIPAA information from
            individual clients of the covered entity.
            <br />
            <br />
            (f) Make any amendment(s) to protected health information in a
            designated record set as directed or agreed to by the covered entity
            pursuant to 45 CFR 164.526, or take other measures as necessary to
            satisfy covered entity’s obligations under 45 CFR 164.526;
            <br />
            <br />
            (g) Maintain and make available the information required to provide
            an accounting of disclosures to the covered entity as necessary to
            satisfy covered entity’s obligations under 45 CFR 164.528. The
            business associate will respond to a request for an accounting of
            disclosures that the business associate receives directly from the
            individual client of the covered entity by forwarding the request to
            the covered entity;
            <br />
            <br />
            (h) To the extent the business associate is to carry out one or more
            of covered entity&apos;s obligation(s) under Subpart E of 45 CFR Part
            164, comply with the requirements of Subpart E that apply to the
            covered entity in the performance of such obligation(s); and
            <br />
            <br />
            (i) Make its internal practices, books, and records available to the
            Secretary for purposes of determining compliance with the HIPAA
            Rules.
            <br />
            <br />
            Permitted Uses and Disclosures by Business Associate

            <br />
            (a) Business associate may only use or disclose protected health
            information as referenced in these TOS as necessary to perform the
            services set forth in the TOS. In addition to other permissible
            purposes, the parties should specify whether the business associate
            is authorized to use protected health information to de-identify the
            information in accordance with 45 CFR 164.514(a)-(c).
            <br />
            <br />
            (b) Business associate may use or disclose protected health
            information as required by law.
            <br />
            <br />
            (c) Business associate agrees to make uses and disclosures and
            requests for protected health information consistent with covered
            entity’s minimum necessary policies and procedures.
            <br />
            <br />
            (d) Business associate may not use or disclose protected health
            information in a manner that would violate Subpart E of 45 CFR Part
            164 if done by covered entity except for the specific uses and
            disclosures set forth below.
            <br />
            <br />
            (e) Business associate may use protected health information for the
            proper management and administration of the business associate or to
            carry out the legal responsibilities of the business associate.
            <br />
            <br />
            (f) Business associate may disclose protected health information for
            the proper management and administration of business associate or to
            carry out the legal responsibilities of the business associate,
            provided the disclosures are required by law, or business associate
            obtains reasonable assurances from the person to whom the
            information is disclosed that the information will remain
            confidential and used or further disclosed only as required by law
            or for the purposes for which it was disclosed to the person, and
            the person notifies business associate of any instances of which it
            is aware in which the confidentiality of the information has been
            breached.
            <br />
            <br />
            (g) Business associate may provide data aggregation services
            relating to the health care operations of the covered entity.
            <br />
            <br />

            <br />
            (a) Covered entity shall notify business associate of any

            business associate’s use or disclosure of protected health
            information.
            <br />
            <br />
            (b) Covered entity shall notify business associate of any changes
            in, or revocation of, the permission by an individual to use or
            disclose his or her protected health information, to the extent that
            such changes may affect business associate’s use or disclosure of
            protected health information.
            <br />
            <br />
            (c) Covered entity shall notify business associate of any

            entity, except that business associate may use or disclose protected
            health information for, and the agreement includes provisions for,
            data aggregation or management and administration and legal
